# Vue + Three.js = Fishing Creator


A simple VueJS and ThreeJS app where the user can add sections and change colors of a fly fishing streamer and either make it bare bones simple with one station or make it a full fledged 4x long streamer. Use it to mock up your next streamer when sitting down at the tying vise or use it to learn some VueJS or ThreeJS.
